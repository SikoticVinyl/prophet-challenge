# Time Series Analysis with Prophet: MercadoLibre Search Trends

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and forecasting search trends data for MercadoLibre, an e-commerce platform, using Facebook's Prophet library for time series analysis.

## Key Components
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Building
3. Forecasting
4. Component Analysis

## Challenges and Learnings

### Understanding the Data
- **Challenge**: Initially, grasping the structure of time series data and its unique characteristics.
- **Learning**: Time series data is sequential and date-indexed. Each data point represents a measurement at a specific time.
- **Tip**: Always visualize your raw data first. Plot the time series to get a feel for trends, seasonality, and any anomalies.

### Data Preparation
- **Challenge**: Preparing the data in the correct format for Prophet.
- **Learning**: Prophet requires specific column names: 'ds' for dates and 'y' for the target variable.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  df = df.rename(columns={'date': 'ds', 'search_trends': 'y'})
  ```

### Using the Prophet Model
- **Challenge**: Understanding the workflow of creating, fitting, and using the model for predictions.
- **Learning**: The process follows a consistent pattern: initialize, fit, predict.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  model = Prophet()
  model.fit(df)
  future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)
  forecast = model.predict(future)
  ```

### Interpreting Results
- **Challenge**: Making sense of the forecast and component plots.
- **Learning**: 
  - The forecast plot shows the historical data, the prediction, and uncertainty intervals.
  - Component plots break down the forecast into trend, yearly seasonality, weekly seasonality, and daily seasonality.
- **Tip**: Focus on overall patterns in the forecast. Look for recurring patterns in the seasonality plots.

## Best Practices
1. Always check your data for completeness and correctness before modeling.
2. Understand the assumptions of your model (e.g., Prophet assumes relatively consistent seasonality).
3. Don't overinterpret short-term fluctuations; focus on overall trends and patterns.

## Further Practice
To solidify my understanding:
1. Try forecasting with different time horizons (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, 1 year).
2. Experiment with Prophet's parameters (e.g., changepoint_prior_scale, seasonality_prior_scale).
3. Apply the same process to different datasets to see how the patterns change.
4. Compare Prophet's results with simple models like moving averages to appreciate its capabilities.
